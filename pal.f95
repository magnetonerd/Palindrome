program palindrome
  implicit none
!This program is designed to find the largest palindrome
!that is the product of two numbers of varying size. The
!default size is two 3 digit numbers.

!Assigning variable types
  integer :: x, d, rev, r, store
  integer :: n1, n2, i, k, size, h, f, w, z
  integer, dimension(1000000) :: n, m

  real :: start, end

!These are the counters for the system
  i = 1
  k = 0
